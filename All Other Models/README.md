# All Models Information

We used the following eight different well-known classification models for the experimental comparison.

1) ResNet-50
2) Inception-V3
3) DenseNet-121
4) MobileNet
5) RuneCNN
6) BreastNet
7) LiverNet
8) HCNNet


***!! NOTE: !!*** 

Each Jupyter notebook includes 

1) All of the above models.
2) Our experimental strategy to classify the binary-class and multi-class samples for each WSI dataset.
3) We also added the confusion matrices and ROC curve analysis for each strategy.
